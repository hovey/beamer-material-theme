## Include as git submodule

Go to your working directory where the presenation should reside. Clone this repository into the folder `theme` and copy the `example.tex` file next to the `theme` folder.
The structure should look like this:

```bash
.
├── theme/
├── example.tex
├── ...
```

The copied `example.tex` serves as the basis for your presentation and can be renamed.
